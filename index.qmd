**Abstract:**

Air pollution, particularly particulate matter (PM), poses significant health risks and environmental challenges globally. Mongolia, a country characterized by diverse geographical features and climatic conditions, experiences notable variations in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations. This manuscript explores the spatial and temporal patterns of PM2.5 and PM10 across Mongolia, identifying/delineating two distinct variations. Utilizing extensive datasets and advanced analytical methods, this study provides comprehensive insights into the dynamics of air quality in Mongolia, which is crucial for formulating effective mitigation strategies and policies.

# Introduction
Air pollution are increasingly recognized as a significant public health issue. Understanding the temporal and spatial variations of air particulate matter is essential for investigating air pollution and providing valuable data for health studies.
Particulate pollutants, known for their profound impact on human health (Dockery and Pope, 1994; Harrison and Yin, 2000; Hong et al., 2002), have been a major concern in urban areas over the past few decades. Children exposed to high levels of air pollution are particularly vulnerable, showing increased rates of asthma, reduced lung function growth, and elevated risks of early cardiovascular disease markers (Bourdrel et al., 2017; Gauderman et al., 2015; Hehua et al., 2017). There is also growing concern about neurodevelopmental impacts, including effects on intelligence, attention, autism, and mood. Likewise, aging populations exposed to higher air pollution levels experience accelerated cognitive decline (Power et al., 2016). Recent studies highlight that even low concentrations of these pollutants can lead to various health issues, premature deaths, and associated with increased morbidity and mortality across all age groups (Zigler et al., 2017). For instance, long-term exposure to low levels of particulate matter, such as concentrations as low as 10 μg/m³ (according to WHO Air Quality Guidelines), has been linked to increased lung cancer incidence in the EU (Hvidtfeldt et al., 2021), with similar concerns reported in Canada (Bai et al., 2019) and significantly higher rates in regions of China with concentrations up to 30 μg/m³. Short-term exposure to elevated PM10 levels has been linked to chronic cardiovascular diseases in Mongolia (Enkhjargal, 2020). The social and economic costs associated with premature deaths from air pollution are estimated to be substantial, exceeding ten billion dollars annually and affecting hundreds of thousands of people **globally** (Gyeonggi Research Institute, 2003).

However, accurately demonstrating these temporal and spatial variations in particulate matter remains a challenge, primarily due to the complexities of assessing exposure during critical developmental periods, such as trimesters, months (Becerra et al., 2013; Gong et al., 2014; Kalkbrenner et al., 2014), or weeks (Chiu et al., 2016).

Globally, 7.3 billion people are exposed to unsafe average annual PM2.5 concentrations (WMO 2021), and according to Rentschler and Leonova (2023) 80% of them living in low- and middle-income countries, where economies often rely heavily on polluting industries. Even within a country like the United States, where could have a clean air, significant disparities exist in air quality among income and racial/ethnic groups, as well as between urban and rural areas (Liu et al., 2021). Because of the different range in the concentrations of particulate matter exist, the thresholds of air quality measure varies among countries, making comparisons difficult (cite), and challenge the investigation of air pollution and develop air quality index, globally. 
One significant reason for this challenge from the  difference in threshold is that the causes and effects of air pollution differ among countries, whether they are natural or industrial, local or transported, seasonal or non-seasonal. For instance, in Mongolia, urban and rural air pollution are strongly influenced by its temperate and dry climatic conditions. Siberian anticyclonic activity governs Mongolia, creating significant vulnerability to winter air pollution in populated areas. The monthly mean concentrations of PM10 (PM2.5) reach their annual maximum in December and January due to air pollution in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia (Jugder). 
Annually, dust storms from the Gobi Desert contribute significantly to land degradation and ambient air pollution, leading to sporadic peaks in PM10 levels reaching as high as 64-234 µg/m³ per day or exceeding 6000 µg/m³ per hour (Jugder). 
Another reason for the existing challenge is a lack of sufficient data and demonstration of spatial and temporal variability of particulate matters due to most previous studies solely focused on the heavy polluted periods or windows. Most existing studies in Mongolia are spatially focused either on urban winter pollution or rural dust storms and are temporally short-term, ranging from weeks to several months, with only a few extending to 4-5 years (Soyol-Erdene), moreover,  employed diverse data collection techniques. This fragmented approach hampers a holistic understanding of the issue.

Therefore, we aims to bridge these gaps by investigating the distinct temporal and spatial variations of PM2.5 and PM10 across urban and rural Mongolia using extensive data from 2008 to 2020. By providing comprehensive insights into air pollution patterns, our findings will inform policymakers and public health officials in Mongolia and similar middle-income countries. This research is crucial not only for addressing national health impacts but also for understanding the transboundary effects of transported pollution, affecting regions downstream such as Korea.

# Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}

## Study area descriptions

Fine and coarse particulate matter monitoring sites were located at Dalanzadgad (43.57°N, 104.42°E), Sainshand (44.87°N, 110.12°E) and Zamyn-Uud (43.72°N, 111.90°E) in the Gobi Desert, and at Ulaanbaatar (--) in capital city of Mongolia (@fig-1).

The map demonstrates: - (spring wind speed, it ... - elevation with the population number.

The spring is defined as dust season for Mongolia, and Gobi is the one of the 3 major Asian dust sources those are Gobi, Taklamahan and Sahara.

In the last 2 decades, due to poverty and natural disasters there is population immigration has taken place from the rural to urban, especially to capital city of Mongolia. Due to tiny infrastructure to provide the mega city with the dense population, it introduces the urban pollution.

Therefore, Ulaanbaatar air particulate matter mainly reflects the coal burning, and partly, natural dust.

## Study data and data analysis

### Data and datasets

Particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 $\mu m$ (PM2.5) and 10 $\mu m$ (PM10) were measured at these sites using an instrument that measures light scattering by air- borne particulates. Meteorological parameters, including wind speed, wind direction and visibility were determined by automatic instruments and are detailed in previous articles (Jugder et al., 2011, 2012; Nishikawa, Sugimoto). The instruments for measuring particulate matters were placed 2.0 m above the ground level (AGL) at Dalanzadgad, Sainshand and Zamyn-Uud (@tbl-1). Wind sensors and visibility (meteorological optical range-MOR) sensors with a maximum measurement range of 20 km were installed at a height of 3 m AGL at the three Gobi sites. At the Ulaanbaatar site, the wind sensor height and a visibility sensor was placed at 15 m AGL.

Datasets were obtained from measurements at Dalanzadgad, Sainshand, and Zamyn-Uud from January 2009 to May 2018, and at Ulaanbaatar from the end of April to May 2008. The data used in the study are based on hourly means derived from 1 and 10 min averages.

### Data quality analysis

*Missing data* We examined the PM data quality, and removed spikes those are above 7 $\mu m$, and when PM10,,. Due to electricity shortage and equipment malfunctions contributed to the bad data, and missing data. In Sainshand station, ... was ... Each stations has some features, we treated each stations separately to remove suspective data.

*Missing data handling with the statistical packages* At last, we filled the missing data with 3-hour maxgaps with imputeTS package for univariate time series, and larger gaps using mtsdi R package (well-used for time-series data), and improved the missing data percents by... from ... to ... Additionally, meteorological parameters such as wind speed, direction, and visibility are integrated into the analysis to elucidate their impact on PM levels.

The MTSDI method (@junger2003missing, @junger2012mtsdi) uses the EM algorithm with the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method, also known as Box--Jenkins model (@box2015time, @meyler1998forecasting). The data provided by ARIMA (p, d, q) depend on the number of autoregressive terms (p), the number of differences (d), and the number of terms in the moving average (q) (@meyler1998forecasting). Default configuration was used. The mtdsi method is widely used to impute missing data like in cosmic data @fernandes2017data. Similar multiple imputation methods have been applied for multivariate solar data @zhang2020solargan, highly univariate seasonal data even with the large amount of missing data @chaudhry2019method, missin data imputation and modeling for leaching processes @he2017study. Recently, @motesaddi2022effects used the mtdsi method to imputing missing data air pollution in Tehran (We used the complete data of temperature (°C), relative humidity (RH) (%), wind speed (m/s), barometric pressure (BP) (mbar), PM10, PM2.5, NO2, CO, and CVD variables to impute SO2 and O3 with the mtdsi R package.).

# Results {#sec-results}

## PM intercomparisons of sites between anthropogenic and natural PM sources

\[AND\] The analysis reveals two distinct spatial and temporal variations in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations across Mongolia. In the first pattern, urban areas, especially the capital city Ulaanbaatar, exhibit significantly higher PM levels compared to rural regions (Batmunkh et al., 2020). This disparity is attributed to anthropogenic activities, including residential heating, industrial emissions, and vehicular traffic. Temporally, winter months coincide with peak pollution levels in urban centers due to increased heating demand and temperature inversions exacerbating pollutant accumulation (Dashdondog et al., 2019).

Conversely, rural and remote areas display lower PM concentrations, with seasonal variations influenced by factors such as dust storms, wildfires, and agricultural practices (Battsengel et al., 2021). Spring and summer elevated PM levels in these regions, primarily driven by dust storms originating from arid landscapes and biomass burning activities. Moreover, meteorological conditions, including wind patterns and precipitation, play a crucial role in dispersing pollutants and shaping temporal trends (Enkhbat et al., 2020).

## Temporal variations

To demonstrate the temporal variations of PM10/PM2.5: by illustrating annual and seasonal changes from 2008 to 2020. a) Discuss the changes in the seasonal maximums (peaks)

b)  Discuss the changes in duration of the dusty or polluted periods

c)  Discuss the inter-annual variations

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

The observed spatial and temporal variations in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations underscore the intricate interplay between anthropogenic and natural factors shaping air quality in Mongolia. While urban areas grapple with pollution stemming from industrialization and urbanization, rural regions contend with the impacts of climatic events such as dust storms and wildfires. This stark dichotomy necessitates tailored interventions that address the specific challenges faced by different regions.　Effective air quality management strategies must account for these disparities, emphasizing targeted interventions tailored to specific regions and seasons.

To combat air pollution effectively, holistic strategies integrating regulatory measures, technological innovations, and public awareness campaigns are imperative. In urban areas, transitioning to cleaner heating technologies, improving public transportation infrastructure, and enforcing emissions standards can significantly mitigate pollution levels. In rural regions, initiatives focusing on sustainable land management practices and early warning systems for dust storms and wildfires are essential.

Furthermore, international collaboration and knowledge sharing can play a pivotal role in addressing Mongolia's air quality challenges. Leveraging expertise and resources from global partners can enhance monitoring capabilities, foster innovation, and support capacity-building efforts in air quality management.

# Conclusions {#sec-conclusions}

This manuscript highlights the complexity of air pollution dynamics in Mongolia, characterized by two distinct spatial and temporal variations in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations.

Future work requires to : By elucidating the contributing factors and underlying mechanisms driving these patterns, this study provides valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and environmental stakeholders. Addressing air quality challenges in Mongolia necessitates multifaceted approaches that integrate regulatory measures, technological innovations, and public awareness campaigns to safeguard human health and ecological well-being.
