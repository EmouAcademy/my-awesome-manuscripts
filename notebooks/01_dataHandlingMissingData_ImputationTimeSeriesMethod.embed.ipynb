    "The MTSDI method (Junger, Santos, and Ponce de Leon (2003), Junger and Leon (2012)) uses the EM algorithm with the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method, also known as Box–Jenkins model (Box et al. (2015), Meyler, Kenny, and Quinn (1998)). The data provided by ARIMA (p, d, q) depend on the number of autoregressive terms (p), the number of differences (d), and the number of terms in the moving average (q) (Meyler, Kenny, and Quinn (1998)). Default configuration was used. The mtdsi method is widely used to impute missing data like in cosmic data Fernandes, Lucio, and Fernandez (2017). Similar multiple imputation methods have been applied for multivariate solar data Zhang et al. (2020), highly univariate seasonal data even with the large amount of missing data Chaudhry et al. (2019), missin data imputation and modeling for leaching processes He et al. (2017). Recently, Motesaddi Zarandi et al. (2022) used the mtdsi method to imputing missing data air pollution in Tehran (We used the complete data of temperature (°C), relative humidity (RH) (%), wind speed (m/s), barometric pressure (BP) (mbar), PM10, PM2.5, NO2, CO, and CVD variables to impute SO2 and O3 with the mtdsi R package.).\n",
